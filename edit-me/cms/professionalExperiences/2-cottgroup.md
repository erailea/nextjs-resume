I worked as a senior full stack software developer and then software developer team leader at Cottgroup, where I worked on a single major product. I gained experience in topics such as queue structures, data security and anonymization, dynamic reporting, scheduled tasks, cache management, PEN Test, as well as team and project management, requirements analysis, building a team.
