I worked as a full stack software developer in Techlife that produces projects for the needs of educational institutions. I took an active role in ORM and SPA transformations and was involved in the creation of project architectures.
I had the opportunity to train myself on Devexpress Xtrareports, Sql Server and pure javascript since Devexpress on reporting, Javascript on the frontend and TSQL on the backend are used extensively.
