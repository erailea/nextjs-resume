At Moneybase, I worked as a senior backend developer on financial systems with a microservice-based architecture. I was responsible for modernizing a legacy reporting module originally built with WinForms by rebuilding it using modern .NET 6 services. I also worked on building asynchronous pipelines for document generation and delivery, and integrated Couchbase with SQL Server using GlueSync for real-time synchronization. I focused on performance improvements in high-load dispatch services and ensured code quality through high test coverage and static analysis tools like SonarQube.
